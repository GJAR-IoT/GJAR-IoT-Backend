# GJAR IoT Project
## Server Backend

Code in this folder (`GJAR_IoT/Backend/*`) is the source for our data server.

### Dependencies

The Backend runs on Python 3 and it uses Flask for API management. We run this on top of an Apache2 Server, but this is really up to you. Our project's specific dependencies are below:

- Python 3
- Flask
- PyYaml
- requests (if not already included in Python distribution)

Also, there are some tools written for Linux Bash, but they are not essential to run the project.
